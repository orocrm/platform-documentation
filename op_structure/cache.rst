Cache in Oro Application
========================

The ``OroCacheBundle`` is responsible for operations with various kinds of caches.

Abstract Cache Services
-----------------------

There are two abstract services you can use as a parent for your cache services:

-  ``oro.file_cache.abstract`` - this cache should be used for caching
   data private for each node in a web farm
-  ``oro.cache.abstract`` - this cache should be used for caching data
   that need to be shared between nodes in a web farm

The following example shows how these services can be used:

.. code-block:: none

    services:
        acme.test.cache:
            public: false
            parent: oro.cache.abstract
            calls:
                - [ setNamespace, [ 'acme_test' ] ]

Also each of these abstract services can be re-declared in the application configuration file, for example:

.. code-block:: none

    services:
        oro.cache.abstract:
            abstract: true
            class:                Oro\Bundle\CacheBundle\Provider\PhpFileCache
            arguments:            [%kernel.cache_dir%/oro_data]

Caching Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. contents:: :local:

Memory Based Cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the most important things when dealing with caches is proper cache
invalidation. When using memory based cache, we need to make sure that we
do not keep old values in the memory. Consider this example:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    class LocalizationManager
    {
        /** @var \Doctrine\Common\Cache\ArrayCache */
        private $cacheProvider;

        public function getLocalization($id)
        {
            $localization = $this->cacheProvider->fetch($id);

            // ... all other operations, fetch from DB if cache is empty
            // ... save in cache data from DB

            return $localization;
        }

    }

Since ``$cacheProvider`` in our example is an implementation of memory
``ArrayCache``, we will keep the data there until the process ends. With
HTTP request this would work perfectly well, but when our
``LocalizationManager`` is used in some long-running cli
processes, we have to manually clear memory cache after every change
with Localizations. Missing cache clearing for any of these cases leads
to outdated data in ``LocalizationManager``.

Persistent or Shared cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us have a look at our example once again. Since
``LocalizationManager`` is used in the CLI and we do not have the shared
memory, we would not be able to invalidate the cache between different
processes. We probably would go for some more persistent (shared) way of
caching, for example, ``FilesystemCache``. Now, we are able to share
cache between processes, but this approach causes performance
degradation. In general, the memory cache is much faster than the persistent
one.

Cache Chaining
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The solution to the issue mentioned above is to keep a healthy balance
between the fast and shared cache. It is implemented in the
``ChainCache`` class.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    namespace Oro\Bundle\CacheBundle\Provider;

    use Doctrine\Common\Cache\ArrayCache;
    use Doctrine\Common\Cache\ChainCache;

    class MemoryCacheChain extends ChainCache
    {
        /**
         * {@inheritdoc}
         */
        public function __construct($cacheProviders = [])
        {
            if (PHP_SAPI !== 'cli') {
                array_unshift($cacheProviders, new ArrayCache());
            }

            parent::__construct($cacheProviders);
        }
    }

This class checks whether a request comes from the CLI. If not, the
memory ``ArrayCache`` is added to the top of the cache providers which
are being used for caching. With these priorities set, all HTTP requests
gain performance when dealing with caches in memory and the CLI
processes have no issues with the outdated data as they use the
persistent cache.

Default Cache Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As you may read in `Readme`_ there are two abstract services you can use
as a parent for your cache services. Default implementations are
following: - for CLI requests: ``MemoryCacheChain`` with only
``Oro\Bundle\CacheBundle\Provider\FilesystemCache`` as a cache provider
- for other requests: ``MemoryCacheChain`` with ``ArrayCache`` on the
top of ``FilesystemCache``

APC Cache
---------

There is a possibility to use APC cache and few steps should be
completed for this.

First of all, APC should be installed and enabled in the system. After
this, the production configuration file (``config_prod.yml``) should be
updated with the following parameters:

.. code-block:: none

    doctrine:
        orm:
            auto_mapping: true
            query_cache_driver:    apc
            metadata_cache_driver: apc
            result_cache_driver: apc

    services:
        oro.cache.abstract:
            abstract:             true
            class:                Doctrine\Common\Cache\ApcCache

At the last step of the configuration, production cache should be cleared.

Caching of Symfony Validation Rules
-----------------------------------

By default, rules for `Symfony Validation Component`_ are cached using
``oro.cache.abstract`` service, but you can change this to make
validation caching suit some custom requirements. To do this, you need
to redefine the ``oro_cache.provider.validation`` service.
