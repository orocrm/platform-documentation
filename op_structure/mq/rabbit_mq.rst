RabbitMQ Transport (via AmqpOroMessageQueue Bundle)
===================================================

The bundle registers AmqpTransportFactory.

AMQP (RabbitMQ) Transport
-------------------------

RabbitMQ provides better and faster messages delivery versus DBAL. You
should prefer to use it if possible.

Options
~~~~~~~

The config settings for the `default RabbitMQ Access Control
settings <https://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html>`__ (a user named
guest with a default password of guest, granted full access to the /
virtual host) are:

.. code:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml

    oro_message_queue:
      transport:
        default: 'amqp'
        amqp:
            host: 'localhost' 
            port: '5672' 
            user: 'guest' 
            password: 'guest' 
            vhost: '/' 

We can also move the specified options to the ``parameters.yml``:

.. code:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml

    oro_message_queue:
        transport:
            default: '%message_queue_transport%'
            '%message_queue_transport%': '%message_queue_transport_config%'
        client: ~

.. code:: yaml

    # app/config/parameters.yml

        message_queue_transport: 'amqp'
        message_queue_transport_config: { host: 'localhost', port: '5672', user: 'guest', password: 'guest', vhost: '/' }

RabbitMQ installation
---------------------

You need to have RabbitMQ **version 3.6.**\ \* installed to use the AMQP
transport. To install the RabbitMQ you should follow the `download and
installation manual <https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html>`__.

After the installation please check you have all the required plugins
installed and enabled.

+---------------+-------------+---------------+

The plugin ``rabbitmq_delayed_message_exchange`` is necessarily needed
for the proper work but it is not installed by default so you need to
download, install and enable it.

To download it use a command like

.. code-block:: none

    curl http://www.rabbitmq.com/community-plugins/v3.6.x/rabbitmq_delayed_message_exchange-0.0.1.ez > {RABBITMQ_HOME}/plugins/rabbitmq_delayed_message_exchange-0.0.1.ez

To enable it use the command

.. code-block:: none

    rabbitmq-plugins enable --offline rabbitmq_delayed_message_exchange

Plugins management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable plugins, use the ``rabbitmq-plugins`` tool:
``rabbitmq-plugins enable plugin-name``

And to disable plugins again, use:
``rabbitmq-plugins disable plugin-name``

You can see a list of which plugins are enabled with:
``rabbitmq-plugins list  -e``

You will see something like:

.. code-block:: none

    [e*] amqp_client                       3.6.5 
    [e*] mochiweb                          2.13.1 
    [E*] rabbitmq_delayed_message_exchange 0.0.1
    [E*] rabbitmq_management               3.6.5
    [e*] rabbitmq_management_agent         3.6.5
    [e*] rabbitmq_web_dispatch             3.6.5
    [e*] webmachine                        1.10.3

The sign ``[E*]`` means that the plugin was explicitly enabled i.e.
somebody enabled manually. The sign ``[e*]`` means the plugin was
implicitly enabled i.e. enabled automatically as it was required for
some other enabled plugin.

Troubleshooting
---------------

The exception

.. code-block:: none

      [PhpAmqpLib\Exception\AMQPRuntimeException]  
      Broken pipe or closed connection   

might be caused by one of the following reasons:

-  The plugin ``rabbitmq_delayed_message_exchange`` is missing
-  The RabbitMQ version is too old (older than 3.5.8)

RabbitMQ Useful Hints
---------------------

-  You can see the RabbitMQ default web interface here if the
   ``rabbitmq_management`` plugin is enabled:
   ``http://localhost:15672/``. `See more details
   here <https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html>`__.
-  You can temporary stop RabbitMQ by running the command
   ``rabbitmqctl stop_app``. The command will stop the RabbitMQ
   application, leaving the Erlang node running. You can resume it with
   the command ``rabbitmqctl start_app``. `See more details
   here <https://www.rabbitmq.com/man/rabbitmqctl.1.man.html>`__.
