Message Queue Jobs and Transport Configuration
==============================================

.. contents:: :local:

Overview
--------

The OroMessageQueue bundle integrates OroMessageQueue component. It adds easy to use
configuration layer, register services and tie them together, register CLI commands.

Jobs
----

The bundle provides an entity and a web gui for :ref:`the jobs <op-structure--mq-component--jobs>`. So the jobs are created in the db and have a web gui where you can monitor jobs status and interrupt jobs.

Usage
-----

First, you have to configure a transport layer and set one to be
default. For the config settings

.. code-block:: none

    # app/config/config.yml

    oro_message_queue:
        transport:
            default: '%message_queue_transport%'
            '%message_queue_transport%': '%message_queue_transport_config%'
        client: ~

we can configure one of the supported transports via parameters:

DBAL Transport
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none

    # app/config/parameters.yml

        message_queue_transport: DBAL
        message_queue_transport_config: ~

:ref:`DBAL transport options <op-structure--mq--mq-bundle--dbal>`

Once you configured everything you can start producing messages:

.. code:: php

    <?php

    /** @var Oro\Component\MessageQueue\Client\MessageProducer $messageProducer **/
    $messageProducer = $container->get('oro_message_queue.message_producer');

    $messageProducer->send('aFooTopic', 'Something has happened');

To consume messages you have to first create a message processor:

.. code:: php

    <?php
    use Oro\Component\MessageQueue\Consumption\MessageProcessor;

    class FooMessageProcessor implements MessageProcessor, TopicSubscriberInterface
    {
        public function process(Message $message, Session $session)
        {
            echo $message->getBody();

            return self::ACK;
            // return self::REJECT; // when the message is broken
            // return self::REQUEUE; // the message is fine but you want to postpone processing
        }

        public static function getSubscribedTopics()
        {
            return ['aFooTopic'];
        }
    }

Register it as a container service and subscribe to the topic:

.. code-block:: none

    oro_channel.async.change_integration_status_processor:
        class: 'FooMessageProcessor'
        tags:
            - { name: 'oro_message_queue.client.message_processor' }

Now you can start consuming messages:

.. code:: bash

    ./app/console oro:message-queue:consume

***Note**: Add -vvv to find out what is going while you are consuming
messages. There is a lot of valuable debug info there.*

Consumer Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``--message-limit=MESSAGE-LIMIT`` Consume n messages and exit
-  ``--time-limit=TIME-LIMIT`` Consume messages during this time
-  ``--memory-limit=MEMORY-LIMIT`` Consume messages until process
   reaches this memory limit in MB

The ``--memory-limit`` option is recommended for the normal consumer
usage. If the option is set a consumer checks the used memory amount
after each message processing and terminates if it is exceeded. For
example if a consumer was run:

.. code:: bash

    ./app/console oro:message-queue:consume --memory-limit=700

then:

-  The consumer processing a message
-  The consumer checks the used memory amount
-  If it exceeds the option value (i.e. 705 MB or 780Mb or 1300 Mb) the
   consumer terminates (and Supervisord re-runs it)
-  Otherwise it continues message processing.

We recommend to always set this option to the value 2-3 times less than
php memory limit. It will help to avoid php memory limit error during
message processing.

We recommend to set the ``--time-limit`` option to 5-10 minutes if using
the ``DBAL`` transport to avoid database connection issues

Consumer Interruption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consumers can normally interrupt the message procession by many reasons:

-  Out of memory (if the option is set)
-  Timeout (if the option is set)
-  Messages limit exceeded (if the option is set)
-  Forcefully by an event:
-  If a cache was cleared
-  If a schema was updated
-  If a maintenance mode was turned off

The normal interruption occurs only after a message was processed. If an
event was fired during a message processing a consumer completes the
message processing and interrupts after the processing is done.

Also a consumer interrupts **if an exception was thrown during a message
processing**.

Supervisord
~~~~~~~~~~~

As you read before consumers can normally interrupt the message
procession by many reasons. In the all cases above the interrupted
consumer should be re-run. So you must keep running
``oro:message-queue:consume`` command and to do this best we advise you
to delegate this responsibility to
`Supervisord <http://supervisord.org/>`__. With next program
configuration supervisord keeps running four simultaneous instances of
``oro:message-queue:consume`` command and cares about relaunch if
instance has dead by any reason.

.. code-block:: ini

    [program:oro_message_consumer]
    command=/path/to/app/console --env=prod --no-debug oro:message-queue:consume
    process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
    numprocs=4
    autostart=true
    autorestart=true
    startsecs=0
    user=apache
    redirect_stderr=true

Internals
---------

Structure
~~~~~~~~~

You can skip it if you are only going to use the component. The
component is split into several layers:

-  **Transport** - The transport API provides a common way for programs
   to create, send, receive and read messages. Inspired by `Java Message
   Service <https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/1.4/api/javax/jms/package-summary.html>`_
-  **Router** - An implementation of `RecipientList <http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/RecipientList.html>`_ pattern.
-  **Consumption** - the layer provides tools to simplify consumption of
   messages. It provides a cli command, a queue consumer, message
   processor and ways to extend it.
-  **Client** - provides a high level abstraction. It provides easy to
   use abstraction for producing and processing messages. It also
   reduces a need to configure a broker.

   Component structure

Flow
~~~~

The client's message producer sends a message to a router message
processor. It takes the message and search for real recipients who is
interested in such a message. Then, It sends a copy of a message for all
of them. Each target message processor takes its copy of the message and
process it.

The message itself has headers and body and they change this way while
traveling through the system:

Custom Transport
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you happen to need to implement a custom provider take a look at
transport's interfaces. You have to provide an implementation for them

Key Classes
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `MessageProducer <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/blob/master/src/Oro/Component/MessageQueue/Client/MessageProducer.php>`_ - The client's message producer, you will use it
   all the time to send messages
-  `MessageProcessorInterface <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/blob/master/src/Oro/Component/MessageQueue/Consumption/MessageProcessorInterface.php>`_ - Each class which does the job has to
   implement this interface
-  `TopicSubscriberInterface <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/blob/master/src/Oro/Component/MessageQueue/Client/TopicSubscriberInterface.php>`_ - Kind of EventSubscriberInterface. It
   allows you to keep a processing code and topics it is subscribed to
   in one place.
-  `MessageConsumeCommand <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/blob/master/src/Oro/Component/MessageQueue/Client/ConsumeMessagesCommand.php>`_ - A command you use to consume messages.
-  `QueueConsumer <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/blob/master/src/Oro/Component/MessageQueue/Consumption/QueueConsumer.php>`_ - A class that works inside the command and watch
   for a new message and once it is get it pass it to a message
   processor.

Unit and Functional Tests
-------------------------

To test that a message was sent in unit and functional tests, you can
use ``MessageQueueExtension`` trait. There are two implementation of
this trait, one for unit tests, another for functional tests:

-  `Oro\Bundle\MessageQueueBundle\Test\Unit\MessageQueueExtension <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/blob/master/src/Oro/Bundle/MessageQueueBundle/Test/Unit/MessageQueueExtension.php>`_
   for unit tests
-  `Oro\Bundle\MessageQueueBundle\Test\Functional\MessageQueueExtension <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/blob/master/src/Oro/Bundle/MessageQueueBundle/Test/Functional/MessageQueueExtension.php>`_
   for functional tests

Also, in case if you need custom logic for manage sent messages, you can
use
`Oro\Bundle\MessageQueueBundle\Test\Unit\MessageQueueAssertTrait <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/blob/master/src/Oro/Bundle/MessageQueueBundle/Test/Unit/MessageQueueAssertTrait.php>`_
or
`Oro\Bundle\MessageQueueBundle\Test\Functional\MessageQueueAssertTrait <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/blob/master/src/Oro/Bundle/MessageQueueBundle/Test/Functional/MessageProcessTrait.php>`_
traits.

Before you start to use traits in functional tests, you need to register
``oro_message_queue.test.message_collector`` service for ``test``
environment.

.. code-block:: none

    # app/config/config_test.yml

    services:
        oro_message_queue.test.message_collector:
            class: Oro\Bundle\MessageQueueBundle\Test\Functional\MessageCollector
            decorates: oro_message_queue.client.message_producer
            arguments:
                - '@oro_message_queue.test.message_collector.inner'

The following example shows how to test whether a message was sent.

.. code:: php

    <?php
    namespace Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Tests\Functional;

    use Oro\Bundle\MessageQueueBundle\Test\Functional\MessageQueueExtension;
    use Oro\Bundle\TestFrameworkBundle\Test\WebTestCase;

    class SomeTest extends WebTestCase
    {
        use MessageQueueExtension;

        public function testSingleMessage()
        {
            // assert that a message was sent to a topic
            self::assertMessageSent('aFooTopic', 'Something has happened');

            // assert that at least one message was sent to a topic
            // can be used if a message is not matter
            self::assertMessageSent('aFooTopic');
        }

        public function testSeveralMessages()
        {
            // assert that exactly given messages were sent to a topic
            self::assertMessagesSent(
                'aFooTopic',
                [
                    'Something has happened',
                    'Something else has happened',
                ]
            );
            // assert that the exactly given number of messages were sent to a topic
            // can be used if messages are not matter
            self::assertMessagesCount('aFooTopic', 2);
            // also assertCountMessages alias can be used to do the same assertion
            self::assertCountMessages('aFooTopic');
        }

        public function testNoMessages()
        {
            // assert that no any message was sent to a topic
            self::assertMessagesEmpty('aFooTopic');
            // also assertEmptyMessages alias can be used to do the same assertion
            self::assertEmptyMessages('aFooTopic');
        }

        public function testAllMessages()
        {
            // assert that exactly given messages were sent
            // NOTE: use this assertion with caution because it is possible
            // that messages not related to a testing functionality were sent as well
            self::assertAllMessagesSent(
                [
                    ['topic' => 'aFooTopic', 'message' => 'Something has happened'],
                    ['topic' => 'aFooTopic', 'message' => 'Something else has happened'],
                ]
            );
        }
    }

In unit tests you are usually need to pass the message producer to a
service you test. To fetch correct instance of message producer in the
unit tests use ``self::getMessageProducer()``, e.g.:

.. code:: php

    <?php
    namespace Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Tests\Unit;

    use Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\SomeClass;
    use Oro\Bundle\MessageQueueBundle\Test\Unit\MessageQueueExtension;

    class SomeTest extends \PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
    {
        use MessageQueueExtension;

        public function testSingleMessage()
        {
            $instance = new SomeClass(self::getMessageProducer());
            
            $instance->doSomethind();

            self::assertMessageSent('aFooTopic', 'Something has happened');
        }
    }
