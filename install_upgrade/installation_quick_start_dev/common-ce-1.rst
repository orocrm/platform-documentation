|oro_app_name|
==============

This topic provides a detailed description of the |oro_app_name| installation process and illustrates
examples of installation scenarios.

The information is grouped into the following sections:

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 2

Step 1: Environment Setup
-------------------------

We are demonstrating the installation process using the certain versions of the recommended environmental components:

.. finish_common_ce_part_1

.. csv-table::
   :widths: 10, 30

   "**OS**","|recommended_OS| (recommended OS)"
   "**Web server**","Nginx v.1.12"
   "**Database**","MySQL v.5.7"
   "**PHP**","PHP-FPM and PHP CLI v.7.1"
   "**Other tools**","NodeJS v.6.14, Git v.1.8.3, Composer v.1.6.4, Supervisord v.3.3"

.. begin_common_ce_part_2

.. note::

   Please refer to the :ref:`System Requirements <system-requirements>` for the complete list of the alternatives of the
   required environment components and their supported versions.

If you are using the same environment, you can reuse the commands provided below without modification. Otherwise, please adjust them to match the syntax supported by the tools of your choice.

.. note:
   In the current installation example we setup the simple one-server application environment. To see recommendations
   how to configure the scalable multi-server Oro application environment please see the
   :ref:`Scalable Environment Configuration <installation--scalable-configuration>` article.

Prepare a Server with OS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Get a dedicated physical or virtual server with at least 2Gb RAM with the |recommended_OS| installed. Ensure that you
can run processes as a *root* user or user with *sudo* permissions.

.. finish_common_ce_part_2

Enable Required Package Repositories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) repository to get the Nginx, NodeJS, Git, Supervisor, and Wget packages required for |oro_app_name| application operation.

Add the EPEL repository to your `yum` package manager by running:

.. code:: bash

   yum install -y epel-release
   yum update -y

Install Nginx, NodeJS, Git, Supervisor, and Wget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install most of the required |oro_app_name| application environment components using the following command:

.. code:: bash

   yum install -y nginx wget git nodejs supervisor yum-utils

Install MySQL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As you need to install MySQL 5.7 to replace the default MariaDB replica in CentoOS, get the MySQL 5.7 package from the MySQL official repository:

.. code:: bash

   wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql80-community-release-el7-1.noarch.rpm && rpm -ivh mysql80-community-release-el7-1.noarch.rpm
   yum-config-manager --disable mysql80-community
   yum-config-manager --enable mysql57-community

Next, install MySQL 5.7 using the following command:

.. code:: bash

   yum install -y mysql-community-server

Install PHP
^^^^^^^^^^^

As you need to install PHP 7.1 instead of CentOS 7 native PHP 5.6 version, get the PHP 7.1 packages from the REMI repository:

.. code:: bash

   wget http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-7.rpm && rpm -Uvh remi-release-7.rpm
   yum-config-manager --enable remi-php71
   yum update -y

Next, install PHP 7.1 and the required dependencies using the following command:

.. code:: bash

   yum install -y php-fpm php-cli php-pdo php-mysqlnd php-xml php-soap php-gd php-mbstring php-zip php-intl php-mcrypt php-opcache

Install Composer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the commands below, or use another Composer installation process described in the
`official documentation <https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx>`_.

.. code:: bash

   php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');" && php composer-setup.php
   php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
   mv composer.phar /usr/bin/composer

Enable Installed Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: bash

   systemctl start mysqld php-fpm nginx supervisord
   systemctl enable mysqld php-fpm nginx supervisord

Step 2: Pre-installation Environment Configuration
--------------------------------------------------

.. begin_common_ce_part_3

Perform Security Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configure *SELinux*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the production environment, it is strongly recommended to keep *SELinux* enabled in the *enforcing* mode.

.. warning:: The actual SELinux configuration depends on the real production server environment and should be configured by an experienced system administrator.

In this guide, to simplify installation in the local and development environment, we are loosening the SELinux mode by setting the permissive option for the **setenforce** mode.
However, your environment configuration may differ. If that is the case, please adjust the commands that will follow in the next sections to match your configuration.

.. code:: bash

   sed -i 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=permissive/g' /etc/selinux/config
   setenforce permissive

Configure Users Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For security reasons, we recommend performing all Oro application-related processes on behalf of two different linux users:

* **Administrative user** (for example, oroadminuser) --- A user should be able to perform administration operations like application installation, update, etc.
* **Application user** (for example, nginx) ---  A user should be able to perform runtime operations that require no changes in the application source code files.

In this guide, to simplify installation in the local and development environment, we are loosening
this requirement and use the superuser permissions to perform Oro application administrative tasks.
However, for your staging or production environment, please adjust the commands that will follow in the next
sections to run environment management commands as well as application install and update via a dedicated admin user.

Commands for running the web server, php-fpm process, cron commands, background processes, etc., are executed via the dedicated *application user* (*nginx*). Reuse them without modification, if you keep the same username. Otherwise, adjust them accordingly.

.. finish_common_ce_part_3

Prepare MySQL Database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Change the Default MySQL Password for Root User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To find the temporary mysql *root* user password that was created automatically, run:

.. code:: bash

   grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log

Use this password to login to mysql CLI as root user and change the temporary password to the new secure one (we have used the `P@ssword123`):

.. code:: bash

   mysql -uroot -p
   ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'P@ssword123';

Replace `P@ssword123` with your secret password. Ensure it contains at least one upper case letter, one lower case letter,
one digit, and one special character, and has a total length of at least 8 characters.

Create a Database for |oro_app_name| Application and a Dedicated Database User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: sql

   CREATE DATABASE oro;
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON oro.* to 'oro_user'@'localhost' identified by 'P@ssword123';
   exit

Replace `oro_user` and `P@ssword123` with a new username and more secure password respectively.
Ensure the password contains at least one upper case letter, one lower case letter, one digit,
and one special character, and has a total length of at least 8 characters.

Change the MySQL Server Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is recommended to use SSD to store the |oro_app_name| data in the MySQL 5.X database.
However, if you are forced to use the HDD, as a precaution, to avoid performance issues, use the remedy explained in the
`optimizing InnoDB Disk I/O <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/optimizing-innodb-diskio.html>`_ article, and hence
set the following configuration parameters in the **/etc/my.cnf** file:

.. code:: bash

   innodb_file_per_table = 0
   wait_timeout = 28800

If you want to store supplementary characters, like 4-bytes emojis, the `utf8mb4` character set can be used.
But in case if you use MySQL older than 5.7 the following configuration parameters should be set in
the **/etc/my.cnf** file:

.. code:: bash

   innodb_file_format = Barracuda
   innodb_large_prefix = 1

Since MySQL 5.7 these parameters are set by default.
More details can be found in `Unicode Support <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/charset-unicode.html>`_
and `InnoDB File-Format Management <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-file-format.html>`_ articles.

Also take a look at
`Setting up the Database to be UTF8 <https://symfony.com/doc/3.4/doctrine.html#configuring-the-database>`_
in Symfony Documentation to learn how to configure an application to use `utf8mb4` character set.
But again in case if you use MySQL older than 5.7 you need to add `row_format: DYNAMIC` option
in `default_table_options` section.

For the changes to take effect, restart MySQL server by running:

.. code:: bash

   systemctl restart mysqld

Configure Web Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. begin_common_ce_part_4

For the production mode, it is strongly recommend to use the HTTPS protocol for the |oro_app_name| public websites, and reserve the
HTTP mode for development and testing purposes only.

The samples of Nginx configuration for HTTPS and HTTP mode are provided below. Update the
`/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf` file with the content that matches the type of your environment.

**Sample nginx Configuration for HTTP Websites (Use in Development and Staging Environment Only)**

.. code::

    server {
        server_name <your_domain_name> www.<your_domain_name>;
        root  /usr/share/nginx/html/oroapp/public;

        access_log /var/log/nginx/<your_domain_name>_https_access.log;
    }

Replace *<your_domain_name>* with your configured domain name. In addition, change *ssl_certificate_key* and
*ssl_certificate* with the actual values of your active SSL certificate.

Optionally, you can enable and configure `Apache PageSpeed module <https://www.modpagespeed.com/>`_ for Nginx to improve
web page latency as described in the :ref:`Performance Optimization of the Oro Application Environment <installation--optimize-runtime-performance>` article.

.. note:: If you choose the Apache web server instead of Nginx one, the example of the web server configuration you can find in the :ref:`Web Server Configuration <installation--web-server-configuration>` article.

.. finish_common_ce_part_4

For the changes to take effect, restart `nginx` by running:

.. code:: bash

   systemctl restart nginx

Configure Domain Name Resolution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. begin_common_ce_part_5

If you are going to use |oro_app_name| in the local environment only, modify the */etc/hosts* file on the server by adding the following line:

.. code::

   127.0.0.1 localhost <your_domain_name>

After this change, the <your_domain_name> URLs opened in the local environment are handled by the local webserver.

To make |oro_app_name| accessible from the remote locations, configure a DNS server to point your domain name to your server IP address.

.. finish_common_ce_part_5

Configure PHP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To configure PHP, perform the following changes in the configuration files:

* In the `www.conf` file (*/etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf*) --- Change the user and the group
  for PHP-FPM to *nginx* and set recommended values for other parameters.

  .. code::

     user = nginx
     group = nginx
     catch_workers_output = yes

* In the `php.ini` file (*/etc/php.ini*) --- Change the memory limit and cache configuration to the following:

  .. code::

     memory_limit = 1024M
     realpath_cache_size=4096K
     realpath_cache_ttl=600

* In the `opcache.ini` file (*/etc/php.d/10-opcache.ini*) --- Modify the OPcache parameter to match the following values:

  .. code::

     opcache.enable=1
     opcache.enable_cli=0
     opcache.memory_consumption=512
     opcache.interned_strings_buffer=32
     opcache.max_accelerated_files=32531
     opcache.save_comments=1

For the changes to take effect, restart PHP-FPM by running:

.. code:: bash

   systemctl restart php-fpm

Step 3: |oro_app_name| Application Installation
