Contribute to Translations
==========================

.. contents:: :local:

Oro applications support localization and internationalization for multiple languages and locales.
All strings that may be translated are defined in the bundle translation domain files and are exposed via the translation management service `Crowdin <https://crowdin.com/>`__ to enable the collaborative translation efforts.

To contribute to OroCRM translation into your native language:

#. :ref:`Join the translation team <translations-join-the-team>`.

#. :ref:`Submit your translations <translations-submit>`.

#. Wait for your translation to be approved.

#. :ref:`Ensure that synchronization is enabled for the target language <translations-language-settings>`.

:ref:`Contact Oro translation team <translations-contact>` if you face any issues (e.g., your translation does not appear in the Oro application after it has been approved).

.. _translations-submit:

Submit Your Translations
------------------------

#. To open the translation project, click **Get Involved** in the email from Crowdin that confirms your OroCrm project team membership.

   Alternatively, use the `OroCRM project <https://crowdin.com/project/oro-crm>`_ link to open the project.

#. Select the target language (e.g. Korean).

   Translations are stored in yaml files organized by bundles (e.g. OroAccountBundle, OroActivityContactBundle) and by groups (e.g. messages, tooltips).

#. Select the yaml file with the translations you would like to contribute to.

#. Submit your translation. For more information on using Crowdin, please see the `Crowdin tutorial <https://support.crowdin.com/for-translators/onlineworkbench/translation-tutorial/>`_.

After you have submitted the translation, it will be queued for `proofreading <https://support.crowdin.com/for-translators/onlineworkbench/proofreading>`_. Other translators can `vote <https://support.crowdin.com/for-translators/onlineworkbench/voting>`_ for it.

When the translation is approved, it is marked with a green check mark and moved to the end of the list on the translation page. Approved translations are merged (published) to the Oro application translations once a day and become available in Oro application in the language settings (to open the language settings, in the main menu, navigate to **System > Configuration > Language Settings**).
