What is Oro Application
-----------------------

Oro application is a PHP web application that is using Symfony as a framework. It provides the following benefits:

* **Runs on any OS**, though Linux is recommended. See :ref:`system requirements <system-requirements>` for more info.
* **Scalable** - Oro application may be easily scaled up and down to meet your company needs (message queue, indexes, search).
* **Extendable** - Oro application may be extended via the packages from the `marketplace <https://marketplace.orocrm.com/>`_ designed by Oro, Oro partners, or Oro community. Also, you may design your own packages to implement the missing functionality.
* **Customizable** - Oro application inherits most of the development techniques enabled by the Symfony framework and extends them. It helps easily customize Oro app for any business needs.

With these out-of-the-box benefits, developers can focus on implementing their unique business logic and build Oro-based applications in less time.
