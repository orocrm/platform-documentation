   :depth: 2

Install Extension from the Oro Marketplace
------------------------------------------

Installing an extension from the Oro marketplace is the least resource-consuming way to expand the existing functionality of the Oro application.

Oro applicationâ€™s marketplace is a catalog service for sharing packages that extend a particular Oro application. On the marketplace, Oro and third-party vendors may publish free or chargeable custom packages to distribute commonly-used extension solutions to the Oro community.

.. note:: See the :ref:`Oro PHP application structure <architecture-oro-php-application-structure>` topic for more information on the definition of a package and  levels of extension and customization.

Browse published extensions for Oro applications on the following marketplaces:

* OroPlatform --- `https://platform-marketplace.orocrm.com/ <https://platform-marketplace.orocrm.com/>`_
* OroCRM --- `https://marketplace.orocrm.com/ <https://marketplace.orocrm.com/>`_
* OroCommerce --- `https://marketplace.orocommerce.com/ <https://marketplace.orocommerce.com/>`_

.. note:: Once the Oro application extension package is `published on the Oro marketplace <https://oroinc.com/b2b-ecommerce/doc/current/dev-guide/extend-and-customize/how-to-add-an-extension-to-oro-marketplace>`_, it is automatically registered in the `Oro Packagist repository <https://packagist.oroinc.com/>`_. See a topic on a :ref:`Distribution Model <architecture-oro-php-application-structure>` for more information on using composer service with Packagist and OroPackagist repositories.

To install an extension, use the package manager CLI (`oro:package:install command`) or the composer CLI (`composer require <extension-name>:<version>` command). For detailed information, please, see the `How To Install Extensions from the Marketplace <https://oroinc.com/b2b-ecommerce/doc/current/dev-guide/install-upgrade-and-patch/how-to-install-extension-from-command-line>`_ topic.

Source Code Customization
-------------------------

In addition to existing extensions, you can create your own customization of the Oro application source code and either use it internally or publish it to the Oro marketplace, if necessary.

.. warning:: Customization may apply to the application only and should be created in a custom bundle in the src folder of your Oro application. Do not customize packages, Oro and Symfony bundles, and components to avoid difficulties when upgrading the customized system.

Prepare for Source Code Customization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. TODO replace the link once the topic is ported to the OroCommerce

Before you begin customizing you Oro application, follow the guidance provided in the `Custom Application <https://oroinc.com/doc/orocrm/current/dev-guide/custom-application>`_ topic to set up your custom application repository for version control, and install Oro application from your custom repository.

Running the application in development mode (via the `http://<oro-application-base-url>/index_dev.php/` link) helps you debug and test your customization steps.

Implement the Customization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: It is highly recommended to follow `Symfony Best Practices <http://symfony.com/doc/2.8/best_practices/index.html>`_ for any custom application that you build on top of Oro applications. Please refer to the :ref:`Oro application structure <architecture-oro-php-application-structure>` and `Symfony Bundle System <http://symfony.com/doc/2.8/bundles.html>`_ for more information.

Use the src directory in the root of your Oro application as a working directory for your custom project.

Create a new bundle to put all your custom code and updated configuration files. To customize your Oro application source code and adjust your Oro application behavior, use the methods described in the sections below.

.. note:: Methods originating from the Symfony framework are marked with the *[Symfony]* prefix, while Oro-specific methods are labeled with the *[Oro]* prefix. Oro-specific methods significantly speed up the development process, like the dynamic modification of the content created at the vendors level and quick definition of the new workflows, configuration options, navigation sets. Generic PHP enabled methods are marked with *[PHP]* prefix.

.. TODO fix the Cookbook link when info is ported to OroCommerce

.. seealso:: See the `Cookbook <https://oroinc.com/orocrm/doc/current/dev-guide/cookbook>`_ section in OroCRM documentation and the Customization topic in the Oro application Developer Guide for additional information.

[PHP] Add a Third-Party Component or Library via Composer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add an existing third-party program component or a library available via `composer <https://getcomposer.org/>`_ to use it in your custom Oro application code.

For example, in the root directory of your Oro application, run the following command to add a math library using composer:

   ```composer require numphp/numphp```

After that, you can use features from the math library in the custom source code:

.. code-block:: none
    :linenos:

    ...

    use \NumPHP\NumArray;

    ...

       $vector = new NumArray([0.12, 6/7, -9]);

    ...

[Symfony] Add a Third-Party Symfony-Compatible Bundle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Similarly, add a Symfony-compatible bundle to your Oro application via composer using the following command:

   ```composer require friendsofsymfony/rest-bundle```

To enable it in the Oro application, register the bundle in the bundles.yml file in your custom bundle:

.. code-block:: none
    :linenos:
    :caption: CustomBundle/Resources/config/oro/bundles.yml

    bundles:
      -  { name: \FOS\RestBundle\FOSRestBundle, priority: 100 }

.. TODO replace the link when doc is ported to Commerce

.. note:: See the topic on `Differences to Common Symfony Applications <https://oroinc.com/orocrm/doc/current/dev-guide/getting-started-book/differences>`_ for more information on bundle registration effect.

This immediately enforces the customization changes defined in the bundle to apply to your Oro application.
However, next, you may need to implement custom changes in the existing business logics to benefit from the enabled capabilities.

[Symfony] Extend the Existing Bundle via Inheritance or Using Compiler Passes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Use Symfony inheritance (e.g. override controllers, templates, routes of this parent bundle) to customize the existing Oro application bundle. For detailed information, please, see the :`How to extend existing bundle <https://oroinc.com/b2b-ecommerce/doc/current/dev-guide/extend-and-customize/how-to-extend-existing-bundle>`_ topic in Oro documentation and `How to use compiler passes <https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container/compiler_passes.html>`_ in Symfony documentation.

.. note:: Inheritance techniques are easier to implement and maintain than the compiler pass approach.

[Symfony] Replace Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Decorate existing services to change their default behavior. For more information, see `How to decorate services <https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container/service_decoration.html>`_ topic in Symfony documentation.

[Symfony] Use Dependency Injection Tags
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the dependency injection tags, you can register a service of specific a type (for example data provider for the layout, custom action for the workflow system, etc.) in the dependency injection container.
To do so, tag your service with a specified dependency injection tag to make it a part of Oro application.

.. add benefits and use cases

For example, to add a new payment method in your OroCommerce application, first create your own implementation of the *PaymentMethodProviderInterface* and tag it with the existing *oro_payment.payment_method_provider* tag, like in the following example:

.. code-block:: none
    :linenos:
    :caption: CustomBundle/Resources/config/services.yml

    custom_bundle.method.provider.payment_method_name:
        class: 'Custom\Bundle\CustomBundle\Method\Provider\NameOfMethodProvider'
        public: false
        tags:
             - { name: oro_payment.payment_method_provider }

The behavior that has already been applied to the default payment methods is now automatically applied to the tagged service too.

[Symfony] Events and Event Listeners
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use event listeners to interfere with the existing data processing flow and customize it. You can also design new business logics for processing the events. For example, to log a number of web-browsers that are connected to the application server through the websockets (WS) protocol, create your own listener of the clank.client.connected event:

.. code-block:: none
    :linenos:
    :caption: CustomBundle/Resources/config/services.yml

    custom_bundle.wss.listener:
       class: Custom\Bundle\CustomBundle\EventListener\WssConnectionEventListener
       tags:
            - { name: kernel.event_listener, event: clank.client.connected, method: onClientConnect }

Remember to implement custom processing of the registered changes, if necessary.

To get the list of listeners registered in the event dispatcher, use the following command:

```php bin/console debug:event-dispatcher```

See the `Event dispatcher <http://symfony.com/doc/current/event_dispatcher.html>`_ topic in the Symfony documentation for more information.

[Oro] Customization via Configuration Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many items in the Oro application features, like workflows, navigation trees, datagrids, dashboard widgets, are defined in the YAML configuration files. You can easily adjust existing and add new items by modifying these files. For example, to add new sections in the System Configuration UI, modify the *Resources/config/oro/system_configuration.yml* file in your custom bundle to add new configuration option.

.. sample

Once added, the option may be displayed in the UI or may affect the Oro application behavior. You may need to implement new or customize existing features to use the new configuration option.

.. add more examples for every type of the items/features: workflow, navigation tree, datagrid, dashboard widget

.. TODO <replace link when the content is synced between OroCRM and OroCommerce

Please, see the `System Configuration <https://oroinc.com/doc/orocrm/current/reference/format/system-configuration>`_ topic for sample configuration files.

[Oro] Customization Using Twig Placeholders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Oro application, you can use a new Twig template {placeholder} token/tag that triggers an event-like behavior when the template is rendered. For example, you can add a new markup to the existing template that is generated at the vendor level and keep other parts of the template intact. Please, see the `Introduction to Placeholders <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/UIBundle#introduction-to-placeholders>`_ topic for more details.

[Oro] Customization by Modifying the Database Schema
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the Oro data migration mechanism to fine-tune the database schema and load initial data to the Oro application. The mechanism that is enabled in the Oro `MigrationBundle <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/MigrationBundle>`_ uses specific PHP files and classes (migrations and fixtures) that help you to fulfill:

* **Data model changes:** Modify the database schema to fit your custom business process
* **Data initialization:** Add required initial data to the database
* **Multi-step data schema modification:** Add a sequential and incremental changes to database in the predefined order, if they depend on the preceding migration completion. Sequential changes could have happened on the different stages of the development. Sample sequential changes are:

  * Add a new user table with id and name columns (initial implementation).
  * Add an email column to the user table (change was implemented on the later stage to cover missing data for the integration).
  * Rename the email column to user email (the column name was lined up with the integrated system).

* **Multi-step data modification:** Adjust the data in the database via fixtures that may depend on other fixtures and be processed after them.
* **Deployment:** Migration of the database-level changes (database schema and data) from the development and staging environments to the production environment.

Please, see the `OroMigrationBundle documentation <https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/MigrationBundle>`_ for more details on database structure and model modification.

Publish Your Complete Customization as a Package on the Oro Marketplace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once your customization is ready, you can publish it in a dedicated repository that follows the :ref:`package repository requirements <architecture-oro-php-application-structure>`, create a reusable package, and share it on the Oro marketplace. See `How to add extension to the Oro marketplace <https://oroinc.com/b2b-ecommerce/doc/current/dev-guide/extend-and-customize/how-to-add-an-extension-to-oro-marketplace>`_ for more information.

Customization via UI
--------------------

For data model and business processes customization, Oro applications provide the entity and workflow management tools in the web UI (e.g. OroCRM and OroCommerce management console). These tools may be used for quick updates of the existing data structure, for example, add a new field to the existing entity data, change the value options, etc.) and enable easy and fast prototyping, for example, for A/B testing of new business processes automation.

.. warning:: Results of the customization via UI is stored in the database. Porting such customization from staging to the production environment happens on the database level using data migration. Compared to programmatic customization, customization via UI lacks the versioning and portability. Please, consider using the customization on the source code level to keep the upgrade process simple.

.. TODO replace link one the information on entities is synced to the OroCommerce

In the **System > Entity Management**, you can create a data model for a new business entity (e.g. add information about the purchase orders and link them  to the B2B orders in OroCommerce), and start using it right away after quick field and relationships configuration. See `Entities Management <https://oroinc.com/orocrm/doc/current/admin-guide/entities>`_ for detailed information.

In the **System > Workflows**, you can automate a workflow to reflect a custom business process in your organization.
